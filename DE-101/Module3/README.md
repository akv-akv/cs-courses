Based on London Airbnb dataset solve one of the following tasks:

1. Analytical tool

In order to find a new object, you need to choose the most attractive neighbourhood and compare specific objects. Neighbourhoods and listings should be compared by the following criteria:

- Number of listings
- Average proce
- Average occupancy (load)
- Room type
- Bedrooms number

The dashboard should andser the question in which neighbourhood is it worth renting a room and analyse top offers (by occupancy) in the area.

### Dataset description

The dataset consists of the following files:

- listings.csv — detailed info about each real estate object
- listings_summary.csv — summarised info about each real estate object
- calendar.csv — real estate object availability schedule
- neighbourhoods.csv — district list
- neighbourhoods.geojson — district spatial data
- reviews.csv — object reviews

In order to solve the problem decided to use data from reviews.csv, reviews_summary.csv and neighbourhoods.geojson
